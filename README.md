#Pokedex
Pokedex is a simple webpage I created with the help of GitHub Copilot. Despite having minimal knowledge of frontend development and APIs, I was able to build this project by leveraging the power of AI-assisted coding.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and API integration.

## API Information
This project uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open RESTful API that provides information about Pokémon. It allows fetching data such as Pokémon names, types, abilities, and more, which are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
